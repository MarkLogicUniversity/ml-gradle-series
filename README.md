# ML-GRADLE Hands-On Exercises 

## Overview:

In the [**ml-gradle** series](http://mlu.marklogic.com/ondemand/index.xqy?q=Series%3A%22ml-gradle%22), we'll examine the **ml-gradle** plug-in for Gradle. The plug-in adds custom Gradle tasks and properties to deploy a wide-range of configurations to MarkLogic servers.

Here is a short list of example resources that can be deployed with **ml-gradle**.

* Application Servers
* Databases and Forests
* Index configurations
* Backup schedules
* REST api extensions
* Transformations and CoRB processing

and much more.
