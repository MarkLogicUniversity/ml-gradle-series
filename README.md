# ML-GRADLE Hands-On Exercises 
## Overview:
In this series, we'll examine the **ml-gradle** plug-in for Gradle. The plug-in adds custom Gradle tasks and properties to deploy a wide-range of configurations to MarkLogic servers.

Here is a short list of example resources that can be deployed with **ml-gradle**.

* Application Servers
* Databases and Forests
* Index configurations
* Backup schedules
* REST api extensions
* Transformations and CoRB processing

and much more.
