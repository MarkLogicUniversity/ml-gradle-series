# ML-GRADLE Hands-On Exercises 
## Episode 3 - Customizing Deployments with ml-gradle

This episode investigates extending configurations created in **Episode 2**. We will extend our configurations to include application code for our Star Wars web page project. The web page will also extract data from our Star Wars content database then display the data in Google Charts. We will also load content to our Star Wars database by using an **ml-gradle** MarkLogic Content Pump (MLCP) task.

## Requirements

To successfully do the hands-on portions for this episode, make sure you have the following installed.

* Ensure you have a 64-bit Operating System. *Important: MarkLogic Server runs only on 64-bit operating systems.*
* MarkLogic Server, Version 9.0-3 or greater installed and started. <http://developer.marklogic.com/products>
* Java, Version 1.8 or greater. <https://java.com/en/download/>
* Gradle, Version 3.5 or greater. <https://gradle.org/install/>
* An internet connection to pull dependencies from Gradle repositories.

## Episode 3 Hands-On Instructions

This episode is divided into 2 different folders. These folder represent the final results of each part. We will be running Gradle tasks on the command prompt (Windows) or in Terminal (CentOS/RedHat or MacOS).

To follow along, do the following.

### `part1-app-deploy` instructions.  

1. Copy the folder called `starwarsproject` in the `part1-app-deploy` folder to the same level as the `episode3` folder. Replace any existing `starwarsproject` folder.  

2. The `episode3` folder should now have the following folders:  
	* `part1-app-deploy`
	* `part2-mlcp`
	* `starwarsproject` <-- created when you copied the folder from the `part1-app-deploy` folder in **Step 1**.	
3. In command prompt (Windows) or terminal session prompt (CentOS/RedHat or MacOS), change to your new `starwarsproject` folder.
	* Type `cd <path to the episode3 files >/episode3/starwarsproject` then press ENTER.

4. If you entered a port number other than **8090** during the **Episode 2** `mlNewProject` task, be sure to edit the `mlRestPort` value in the `gradle.properties` file and change the value.

5. Note the inclusion of our project application code in the `src/main/ml-modules/root` and `src/main/ml-modules/services` directories.
	* `root` - contains our web page code and javascript needed to display Google Charts in the browser.
	* `services` - contains our MarkLogic Server-side JavaScript code to extend MarkLogic's REST api to query our content database for Star Wars character names and heights. The data will be returned to the browser in JSON format.

5. Run the **ml-gradle** `mlDeploy` task.
	* Type `gradle mlDeploy` then press ENTER.

6. In a web browser, go to <http://localhost:8090/index.xqy> to see the project web page. Edit the port number (:8090) if your value of `mlRestPort` in the `gradle.properties` file is different.
	* No data will display in the charts since we have not yet loaded content to the content database.

7. Do **not** run the `mlUndeploy` task. We will load content in the next section then refresh our web page to display the data in our Google Charts. 

### `part2-mlcp` instructions

1. Copy the folder called `starwarsproject` from the `part2-mlcp` folder to the same level as the `episode3` folder. Replace the existing `starwarsproject` folder.

2. The `episode3` folder should still have the following folders:  
	* `part1-app-deploy`
	* `part2-mlcp`
	* `starwarsproject` <-- created when you copied the folder from the `part2-mlcp` folder in **Step 1**.	

3. In a command prompt (Windows) or terminal session prompt (CentOS/RedHat or MacOS), change to your new `starwarsproject` folder.
	* Type `cd <path to the episode3 files >/episode3/starwarsproject` then press ENTER.

4. View the Gradle task that will load our content.
	* View the `build.gradle` file in a text editor of your choice.
	* We have added a `repositories` section. This tells Gradle where to look for dependencies in addition to Gradle's default repository.
	* We have added a `configuration` label called `mlcp`. This segregates our mlcp-related dependencies.
	* In the `dependencies` section, we point to where to download the MLCP Java libraries.
	* Finally, we have created a new Gradle task called `deployContent`.

5. Run the **ml-gradle** `mlDeploy` task.
	* Type `gradle mlDeploy` then press ENTER.
	* This will ensure we have all dependencies for loading our content.

6. Deploy the Star Wars character content. Run our custom Gradle  `deployContent` task.
	* Type `gradle deployContent` then press ENTER.

7. In a web browser, refresh the url <http://localhost:8090/index.xqy> to see the project web page. Edit the port number (:8090) if your value of `mlRestPort` in the `gradle.properties` file is different.
	* The Google Charts will now display data from your `starwars-content` database.

8. Undeploy the configuraitons.  
	* Type `gradle mlUndeploy -Pconfirm=true` then press ENTER.
	* Your deployed configurations have been removed from your MarkLgoic Server. You can go to the Admin Interface in your browser to verify. <http://localhost:8001>

## Next Steps
When you have completed `part2-mlcp`, you have finished with the Episode 3 hands-on exercises.

We hope you have enjoyed this episode.
